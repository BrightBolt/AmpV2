## Battlemage
- WIP Battlemage, a melee/range hybrid who fights with electromagnetic attacks. Right now he's just a slightly modified henrymod though. Updated to new HenryMod template.

## To-Do
- Literally everything lmao


## What's What?
- Bolt: Turns player into a bolt of electricity, giving them free movement and 300% movement speed. I was trying to use the volcanic egg as a baseline for this ability, where I'd just create a new asset that had the exact same properties and then modify it to look like lightning instead of the unmodified fireball-like appearance. Ran into a couple issues there including fucked up scripts that I'm not sure what caused. To extract assets and stuff I was using GameImporter.

- Fulmination: Fires out a consistent stream of lightning for 5 seconds that chains to other enemies. Think artificer's flamethrower but with a ukelele effect, which is exactly what I was trying to code; the current code for this skill is mostly ripepd straight from artificer's flamethrower skill, with some lightning orb stuff here and there. Unfortunately, I could never get the effects to show up; enemies would take damage as if the beam was there, but the beam itself was invisible; also couldn't get chaining to work.

- Voltaic Bombardment: Alternate special skill that (in theory) summons a huge targeted lightning bolt that deals AOE damage; basically captain's orbital strike but with lightning. Not really much, if anything, done on this skill. Any code in there can be disregarded and deleted at leisure.

## Changelog
