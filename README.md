## Battlemage
- WIP Battlemage, a melee/range hybrid who fights with electromagnetic attacks. Right now he's just a slightly modified henrymod though. Updated to new HenryMod template.

## To-Do
- Finish Skill Code
- Animations
- Character Model
- Skill Art (For UI)
- Custom Skill Effects


## What's What?
- Bolt: Turns player into a bolt of electricity, giving them free movement and 500% movement speed. Might want to add extra hurtbox filtering in the future, and adjust effect/camera lerp time, and maybe decrease movement speed but otherwise functions well.

- Fulmination: Fires out a consistent stream of lightning for 5 seconds that chains to other enemies. Think artificer's flamethrower but with a ukelele effect, which is exactly what I was trying to code; the current code for this skill is mostly ripepd straight from artificer's flamethrower skill, with some lightning orb stuff here and there. Unfortunately, I could never get the effects to show up; enemies would take damage as if the beam was there, but the beam itself was invisible; also couldn't get chaining to work.

- Voltaic Bombardment: Pretty much done, just needs to add effect.

## Changelog
