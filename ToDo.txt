To do:
- SoTS Update
    - network testing
    - Effect pooling
    - Orig stuff
    - Post processing (CreateLightningPrefab) see how its been changed
    - luminous shot functionality
    - NemAmp
	- Furious spark tracer disappears unusually fast
    - Amp
	- Voltaic bombardment has no post-processing

- General
    - Change mod icon to have new Amp character portrait
- Amp
    - Test amp animation bugs (e.g. using pulse leap while holding voltaic bombardment breaks the animation)
    - Implement Amp animations, making sure none of them are in base.isauthority calls
    - Adjust magnetic vortex VFX
    - Change functionality of Amp plasma slash	
    - Fix invisible amp vfx in multiplayer (this should only be the lorentz cannon charge prefab)
    - Decrease attenuation for amp surge explosion, also now a lot of amp sounds are too quiet
    - Rebalance amp melvin, a bit TOO strong
    - Try using r2networkingAPI for amp's surge skill
    - Decrease pulse leap explosion size
    - Magnetic vortex special effect?
    - Plasma Slash
	- Change functionality
	- Multiplayer projectile becomes invisible?
    - Surge
	- Make momentum cancel on early exit in multiplayer
	- Try to fix glitchiness if possible
	- Decrease attenuation of explosion sound
    - Fulmination
	- Consider using similar chain effect to NemAmp
    - Make Typhoon mastery skin actually unlock normally
- NemAmp
    - Make nemamp body disappear in multiplayer
    - Finish Galvanic Cleave
    - Finish Radiant Judgement (new name for photon shot)

For galvanic cleave, want:
	-If in the air, reach to the sky and perform a downwards swing that hits enemies directly in front, above, and below
	- Hold to charge forward?


- Clean up unity project animations folder
- Adjust animations so aiming up actually makes you do things up
- Alt special ideas:
    - Fire a blast of light in front of you that deals XXX% damage and detonates controlled charge for XXX% damage. Hold the ability to focus the blast into a long range beam of light that deals XXX% damage and detonates controlled charge for XXX% damage.
	- Blast is quick, AOE, but shorter range and lower CC damage
    - Summon a Judgement Orb. After 3 seconds, the Judgement Orb splits and blasts every enemy Nemesis Amp has attacked during this time for 3 times the damage dealt to the target.
    - Pierce an enemy with a needle of light. 

- Add ancient scepter support for nemamp
	-voltaic onslaught now causes enemies to give enemies a tesla coil-like status effect that shocks them & enemies next to them, with a duration dependent on how many stacks of controlled charge they had
	- OR voltaic onslaught now adds extra lightning bombs to enemies (amount determined by CC stacks) that explode after a duration and chain to other enemies in the vicinity

- Add risk of options support
- Add skills++ support
- Add support for that one extra animation mod (badass emotes?)
DONE!
