To do:
- Add lang file to mod
- Add crosshair/vfx indicator for when nemamp has plasma bolt
- Develop code that destroys onslaught indicator if the special isnt voltaic onslaught (e.g. heretic ruin)
- Test amp animation bugs (e.g. using pulse leap while holding voltaic bombardment breaks the animation)
- Implement Amp animations, making sure none of them are in base.isauthority calls
- Fix invisible amp vfx in multiplayer (this should only be the lorentz cannon charge prefab)
- Standardize nemamp passive meter position to be under health bar across all resolutions
- Rebalance amp melvin, a bit TOO strong
- Fix mastery skins not unlocking on monsoon obliterate bug
- Implement lorentz blades animations when idle
- NemAmp Lore
- Try using r2networkingAPI for amp's surge skill
- Clean up unity project
- Adjust animations so aiming up actually makes you do things up
- Alt special (fire a continuous beam of light in front of you that deals 100% damage and detonates stacks of controlled charge for 400% damage). 
- Add ancient scepter support for nemamp
	-voltaic onslaught now causes enemies to give enemies a tesla coil-like status effect that shocks them & enemies next to them, with a duration dependent
	on how many stacks of controlled charge they had; a base of 2 seconds with +1 second per stack. this cannot be reset until the status has run out)
	- OR voltaic onslaught now adds extra lightning bombs to enemies (amount determined by CC stacks) that explode after a duration and chain to other enemies in the vicinity
	- OR voltaic onslaught is now a global ability that strikes every enemy in the stage (this might be too laggy)
	- Laser now deals even more bonus damage for every controlled charge stack and causes enemies to explode in a radius determined by
	the amount of controlled charge stacks they have 
	- OR and irradiates enemies causing them to 
- Add risk of options support
- Add skills++ support
- Add support for that one extra animation mod (badass emotes?)
DONE!
