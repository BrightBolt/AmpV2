Suggestions:
Fix bug where fulmination doesn't exit correctly and thus doesn't destroy the lightning tether or muzzle vfx (done?)


To do prerelease:
- Multiplayer
	- Can't see other nemamps spawn animation
	- Voidsurge 
		- Plasma projectile has inconsistent collision, & shock debuff only lasts for 1 second instead of 5)
		- Dash and ball don't count towards passive as clients (removed the override, check again)
	- Voltaic Onslaught
		- Range indicator should only be visible for the person playing nemamp
	- Static field 
		- Might count too early towards passive, on aim instead of on fire; check
	- Death switches to spectator view too early (check, if it breaks put an entitystate.destroy back in the spawnexplosion method)
	- Invisible vfx:
			- Static field muzzle flash (unimportant)
			- Lightning ball muzle flash (unimportant) 
			- lightning stream muzzle prefab (kind of important) (glitches out and can't see properly)
			- voidsurge dash prefab (very important) 
			- Lorentz blades aiming prefabs (important) 
			- Lightning stream vfx? check if this shows up, since its j a linerenderer (very important)
	- can't hear other nemamp's furious spark fire sfx (super high attenuation?)
	- Host can't see client nemamps, but clients can see host nemamp (Adjusted invisibility code, check again)
- Sprint Animation review?
- Make lightning ball must key press
- Increase attenuation for nemamp's sounds
- Consider adjusting lorentz cannon interrupt priorities

Amp To Do:
- Implement anims
- Fix sawmerang bug

To do post release:
- Add ancient scepter support for nemamp
	-voltaic onslaught now causes enemies to give enemies a tesla coil-like status effect that shocks them & enemies next to them, with a duration dependent
	on how many stacks of controlled charge they had; a base of 2 seconds with +1 second per stack. this cannot be reset until the status has run out)
	- OR voltaic onslaught now adds extra lightning bombs to enemies (amount determined by CC stacks) that explode after a duration and chain to other enemies in the vicinity
	- OR voltaic onslaught is now a global ability that strikes every enemy in the stage (this might be too laggy)
- Add risk of options support
- Add skills++ support
- Add support for that one extra animation mod (badass emotes?)
DONE!
