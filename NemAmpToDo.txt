To do:
- General
    - Add lang file to mod for Trevor & RU translation
- Amp
    - Fix idle animation sword not touching shoulder
    - Fix amp css icon being blurry
    - Test amp animation bugs (e.g. using pulse leap while holding voltaic bombardment breaks the animation)
    - Implement Amp animations, making sure none of them are in base.isauthority calls
    - Adjust magnetic vortex VFX
    - Change functionality of Amp plasma slash	
    - Fix invisible amp vfx in multiplayer (this should only be the lorentz cannon charge prefab)
    - Decrease attenuation for amp surge explosion, also now a lot of amp sounds are too quiet
    - Rebalance amp melvin, a bit TOO strong
    - Try using r2networkingAPI for amp's surge skill
    - Decrease pulse leap explosion size
- NemAmp
    - Make nemamp body disappear in multiplayer
    - Implement lorentz blades animation (?)
    - Make static field vfx a cylinder instead of a sphere?
    - Finish Galvanic Cleave
    - Finish Photon Shot

For galvanic cleave, want:
	-If in the air, reach to the sky and perform a downwards swing that hits enemies directly in front, above, and below
	- Hold to charge forward?


- Clean up unity project animations folder
- Adjust animations so aiming up actually makes you do things up
- Alt special:
	- Fire a blast of light in front of you that deals XXX% damage and detonates controlled charge for XXX% damage. Hold the ability to
	focus the blast into a long range beam of light that deals XXX% damage and detonates controlled charge for XXX% damage.
	- This is to be more technical, and both methods should have good sides: blast is quick, AOE, but sshorter range and lower CC damage
	- Fire a burst, OR lock on and fire multiple beams
	- OR instead of a shotgun burst, make it a short energy pulse/sword slash?
	- OR a giant orb of electricity that you spawn that functions similar to loader pylon and that you can detonate for big damage
- Add ancient scepter support for nemamp
	-voltaic onslaught now causes enemies to give enemies a tesla coil-like status effect that shocks them & enemies next to them, with a duration dependent
	on how many stacks of controlled charge they had; a base of 2 seconds with +1 second per stack. this cannot be reset until the status has run out)
	- OR voltaic onslaught now adds extra lightning bombs to enemies (amount determined by CC stacks) that explode after a duration and chain to other enemies in the vicinity
	- OR voltaic onslaught is now a global ability that strikes every enemy in the stage (this might be too laggy)
	- Laser now deals even more bonus damage for every controlled charge stack and causes enemies to explode in a radius determined by
	the amount of controlled charge stacks they have 
	- OR and irradiates enemies causing them to 
- Add risk of options support
- Add skills++ support
- Add support for that one extra animation mod (badass emotes?)
DONE!
