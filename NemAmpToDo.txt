To do:
- Test amp animation bugs (e.g. using pulse leap while holding voltaic bombardment breaks the animation)
- Implement Amp animations, making sure none of them are in base.isauthority calls
- Fix invisible amp vfx in multiplayer (this should only be the lorentz cannon charge prefab)
- Fix mastery skins not unlocking on monsoon obliterate bug
- Implement lorentz blades animations when idle
- NemAmp Lore
- Try using r2networkingAPI for amp's surge skill
- Clean up unity project
- Adjust animations so aiming up actually makes you do things up
- Alt special (fire a continuous beam of light in front of you that deals 100% damage per tick and detonates stacks of controlled charge
every tick for a 400% damage short range explosion). Instead of a cooldown, works on stocks (ammo), has 100 stocks that decay at 33/s
- Add ancient scepter support for nemamp
	-voltaic onslaught now causes enemies to give enemies a tesla coil-like status effect that shocks them & enemies next to them, with a duration dependent
	on how many stacks of controlled charge they had; a base of 2 seconds with +1 second per stack. this cannot be reset until the status has run out)
	- OR voltaic onslaught now adds extra lightning bombs to enemies (amount determined by CC stacks) that explode after a duration and chain to other enemies in the vicinity
	- OR voltaic onslaught is now a global ability that strikes every enemy in the stage (this might be too laggy)
	- Laser skill now lasts for 5 seconds and controlled charge detonations now add a stack of burning.
- Add risk of options support
- Add skills++ support
- Add support for that one extra animation mod (badass emotes?)
DONE!
