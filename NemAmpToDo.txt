To do prerelease:
- Why does kill_all player (which calls healthcomponent.suicide) skip to exiting after 1 second?
- Multiplayer
	- Death explosion plays most of the time, but sometimes doesn't? (check, added hasspawnedexplosion check)
		- Explosion doesn't destroy body on server for some reason???? Host can still see it
	- Flux Blades
		- Can't hear fire sfx (probably another isauthority issue)
	- Voidsurge 
		- Plasma projectile has inconsistent collision (check)
	- Invisible vfx:
			- Lightning ball muzle flash (unimportant) 
			- lightning stream muzzle prefab (kind of important) (glitches out and can't see properly)
			- Lorentz blades aiming prefabs (important) 
			- Lightning stream vfx? check if this shows up, since its j a linerenderer (very important) 
				- error appears on client when server uses skill, seemingly randomly; probably to do with rightMuzzleTransform
- Lightning stake spawn sfx
- Lightning stake interrupt priorities/state machine interactions
- Adjust animations so aiming up actually makes you do things up
- Implement lorentz blades animations when idle

Amp To Do:
- Implement anims
- Fix sawmerang bug

To do post release:
- Clean up unity project
- Alt special (fire a continuous beam of light in front of you that deals 100% damage per tick and detonates stacks of controlled charge
every tick for a 400% damage short range explosion). Instead of a cooldown, works on stocks (ammo), has 100 stocks that decay at 33/s
- Add ancient scepter support for nemamp
	-voltaic onslaught now causes enemies to give enemies a tesla coil-like status effect that shocks them & enemies next to them, with a duration dependent
	on how many stacks of controlled charge they had; a base of 2 seconds with +1 second per stack. this cannot be reset until the status has run out)
	- OR voltaic onslaught now adds extra lightning bombs to enemies (amount determined by CC stacks) that explode after a duration and chain to other enemies in the vicinity
	- OR voltaic onslaught is now a global ability that strikes every enemy in the stage (this might be too laggy)
	- Laser skill now lasts for 5 seconds and controlled charge detonations now add a stack of burning.
- Add risk of options support
- Add skills++ support
- Add support for that one extra animation mod (badass emotes?)
DONE!
